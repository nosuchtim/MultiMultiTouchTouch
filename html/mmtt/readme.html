<h1>README for MultiMultiTouchTouch 2.0</h1>
<p>
The MMTT (MultiMultiTouchTouch) program uses a 3D camera (such as the
Creative Senz3D or the Microsoft Kinect) to create multiple 3D multitouch regions
in mid-air that you can interact with by merely waving your hands (or other objects)
within regions that have been defined.
The <a href=http://spacepalette.com>Space Palette</a> instrument is
one of its applications, you can find YouTube videos and and more details at
<a href=http://spacepalette.com>http://spacepalette.com</a>.
This document describes how to use MMTT.
<h2>Installation</h2>
If you're reading this document, you've already installed the MMTT package.
You'll find a number of program shortcuts for various things
in the "All Programs -> Nosuch Media -> MultiMultiTouchTouch" directory.
If this is the first time you've installed it,
you will probably need to install a few other things (like the 3D camera
drivers), which you can do by running:
<ul>
	<li>"Install EVERYTHING"
</ul>
If you want to be more selective (for example if you already have Kinect or Senz3D drivers installed), the shortcuts for installing individual prerequisites are:
<ul>
	<li>Install Kinect Runtime
	<li>Install Kinect SDK
	<li>Install Processing
	<li>Install Senz3D Runtime
	<li>Install Senz3D SDK
</ul>
<h2>Configuration Files</h2>
In the "Documents" directory of your Windows login (i.e. %USERPROFILE%\Documents ),
you will find a sub-directory named "Nosuch Media\MultiMultiTouchTouch\config".
You can open this directory using "Open configuration directory".
The file "mmtt.json" there controls the default behaviour of MMTT.
Edit that file with the text editor of your choice, and adjust the values
within it to reflect your desires.
The most important values to adjust are "camera" and "patch".
<p>
By default, the value for camera is "senz3d", for the
Creative Senz3D camera (which can be purchased for $170 from Amazon.com).
This camera is very nice for desktop use because it is
much shorter-range than the Kinect.  If you have a Microsoft Kinect,
change the camera value to "kinect".
<p>
The "patch" value should be
the name of a file within the "Nosuch Media\MultiMultiTouchTouch\config\mmtt" directory.
These files define the regions that are recognized by MMTT - each region is a separate
3D multitouch surface.
By default, the value of "patch" is "quadrants_senz3d".  If you are using a Kinect, change the vlue to "quadrants_kinect".
<h2>Starting MMTT</h2>
Use the "Run MMTT" shortcut to start the program.
If you don't see a window, you should see an error popup that explains the reason (e.g.
"No camera detected").  If you don't see any window or errors, use the "Monitor Debug Output"
shortcut to see if there are any errors in the debug logfile,
or just look at the file "Nosuch Media\MultiMultiTouchTouch\log\mmtt.debug" in your
Documents directory.
<h2>Controlling MMTT</h2>
When MMTT is running, you interact with it by pointing your browser at
<a href=http://127.0.0.1:4444>http://127.0.0.1:4444</a>.
<h2>Usage Scenarios</h2>
The 3D multitouch regions that MMTT understands are bounded on one side
by a flat plane.  If you are using a physical frame, this is
the plane of the physical frame.
The location of this plane is controlled in the browser interface
by the "Depth for ... Detection Plane" values.
The Z (depth) direction of each 3D multitouch region starts at this plane
(meaning that the Z value at the plane is 0), and the positive direction
points toward the 3D camera.
To define the regions, you can either explicitly specify the region coordinates in the config file, or use a physical frame (any flat surface with large holes).
MMTT was primarily designed to be used with a physical frame
(like the <a href=http://spacepalette.com>Space Palette</a>),
which simplifies the
registration of the regions as well as
providing visual guidance for both the player and audience.
<h3>Using coordinates to define the regions</h3>
If you don't have a physical frame, the easiest way to define the regions is to specify
the coordinates explicitly in the config file.   The file
config/mmtt/quadrants_senz3d.json is an example which defines
four regions that cover the entire camera field of view.
The "regions" value in the file defines four regions.
The "first_sid" value in a region defines the first SID
(the TUIO Session ID) for each
cursor (hand or object) that appears in that region.  For example,
if "first_sid" is 2000,
the first hand in that region will have SID 2000, the second hand will have
SID 2001, and so on.
<h3>Using a physical frame to define the regions</h3>
To use a physical frame, first you need to make one.
One easy and quick way is to cut holes in a sheet of foam core board.
Anything that is flat and has large open regions will work.
The open regions don't have to be rectangular, but should be at least a few inches high and/or wide.
The parts of the frame between the open regions should be at least 1/2" wide,
so that the 3D camera can see them.
<p>
Using a physical frame requires a one-time operation that "registers" the regions of the frame,
determining the coordinates of the regions.  Here are the steps.
<ol>
<li>Put the frame in front of the 3D camera.
<li>Start the MMTT program
<li>Go to the "MMTT Calibration (Advanced)" page in the browser-based interface.
<li>Click on "STOP sending TUIO (Shows Raw Depth)"
<li>Position the frame so that it's centered in the image.
<li>Click on "START sending TUIO".  The image may disappear until you adjust the depth values in the next step.
<li>
Adjust the parameters of the depth thresholding, which are listed as:
<ul>
	<li>Depth for Top of Detection Plane
	<li>Depth for Bottom of Detection Plane
	<li>Depth for Mask Alignment
</ul>
These parameters identify the distance from the 3D camera
to wherever the frame (Mask Alignment) and your hands (Detection Plane) will be.
The goal is to set the Depth for Top/Bottom of Detection Plane so that your flat frame is included,
but things beyond the plane of the frame (like your body) are not included.
The reason there are Top and Bottom values is to allow some skew correction in the
vertical direction; the 3D camera will usually be centered horizontally with respect to the frame,
but may not be centered vertically.
<li>
Start the manual registration process with the "New Registration Start" button on the
browser-based user interface.
Then, stick your hand into each hole of the frame that you want to use, in order.
When you pull your hand out of each hole, you should see (in the image
on the screen) the color of that region change to the next color in
the <a href=./colors.html>color sequence</a>.
The registration process concludes either when you stick your hand into
the first region for a second time, or when you press the "New Registration Stop"
button.
<li>
Type a new configuration name into the text field next to the
"Save Patch" button, and press "Save Patch".
This will save two files - a .json file with the
current control parameters, and a .ppm (portable pix map) image file with the current region map that you've just defined.
</ol>
<p>
The saved configuration will be in the config/mmtt directory,
with a .json suffix.
You can edit this configuration manually with a text editor, if you prefer.
Setting the "patch" value in the config/mmtt.json file will set the
default configuration.
If you move the 3D camera or the frame, you may have to
tweak the threshold parameters and/or
re-register and re-save the configuration.
If things have only moved slightly, you should be able
to just press the "RePoke" button at the top of the
browser-based user interface, which pretends to re-register by sticking a "virtual hand" in the center of each of the
currently-configured regions.
After doing this, you should save the configuration again.
<p>
<h3>Using a specially-color image to define the regions</h3>
If you look at the image file <b>colorexample.ppm</b> (which
is a Portable Pixmap image), you will see the type of colored image
that can be used to configure MMTT without having a physical frame.
Each different color identifies a different region.  White is used to identify
the frame (if it is present), which gets ignored when looking for your hands.
This <a href=colors.html>Color Reference Page</a> shows you the different colors
you should use in this image for each region.  If you create a .ppm file
containing an image with these colors, you can then load it using the
browser-based user interface.
<h3>Debugging</h3>
Debugging and status information can be viewed with <a href=http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896647>debugview</a>.
The browser-based user interface
contains a number of controls toward the bottom of the page that can be
used to see what's going on.  For example, the "Show Region Map" button
will let you see the current map of regions.  The "Show Raw Depth" button
will show you the raw depth image with no thresholding.

<h3>OSC / TUIO output</h3>
<a href=http://www.tuio.org/?specification>TUIO is a standard</a> for multitouch events using OSC.
By default, the TUIO output of MMTT gets sent to port 3333 of host 127.0.0.1,
using the profile for 25D surfaces
(i.e. the OSC messages start with /tuio/25Dblb).
You can change this by setting the "tuio.25d.clientlist" value in the "mmtt.json" file.  This value is a semicolon-separated list of host:port values.
For example, if you set the value to "127.0.0.1:3333;127.0.0.1:7777",
it would tell MMTT to send TUIO to two clients on your local host (127.0.0.1),
one at port 3333 and one at port 7777.
If you are on a network, you can specify other hosts as well.
<p>
If you want to interact with programs that expect the TUIO 2D profile,
you can tell MMTT to use the 2D profile by setting the "tuio.2d.clientlist"
value in the "mmtt.json" configuration file.
<p>
The TUIO session IDs indicate which region of the frame they are from.
The session ID values are specified in the patch file for a configuration,
with the "first_sid" value.  If you train by using a physical frame,
the values of
